          <h2>Naruto Shippuden</h2>
          <p>
            More than two years have passed since the most recent adventures in the Hidden Leaf
             Village, ample time for ninja wannabe Naruto Uzumaki to have developed skills worthy 
             of recognition and respect. The hyperactive youngster has trained extensively with 
             Jiraiya-sama and returned to Konoha to reunite with friends and, perhaps, partake in 
             more pranks than schoolwork. But Naruto is more determined than ever to become the 
             greatest ninja, and his hard-earned improvements are put to the ultimate test against
              newer, stronger enemies. "Naruto: Shippuden" is adapted from Part II of the "Naruto" 
              comic book series by Masashi Kishimoto.

          <h2>Death Note</h2>
          <p>
            Death Note is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by 
            Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who stumbles across
             a mysterious otherworldly notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the Shinigami
              Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written
               in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death
                Note to carry out a world-wide massacre of individuals whom he deems morally unworthy
                 of life to change the world into a utopian society without crime, using the alias 
                 of a god-like vigilante named "Kira" ("キラ", the Japanese transliteration of the 
                 English word: killer) and the subsequent efforts of an elite task-force of law 
                 enforcement officers, consisting of members of the Japanese police force, led by L,
                  an enigmatic international detective whose past is shrouded in mystery, to apprehend
                   him and end his reign of terror.
