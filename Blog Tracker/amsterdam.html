            <p>You might be wondering, what places I were able to visit in <span class="underline-text">7 hours?</span></p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold-text underline-text">Amsterdam</span> has a lot to offer, from The beautiful canals running through the entire city all the way to the tiny shops. Amsterdam is like a painting coming to life. With a <span class="underline-text">10 hour</span> layover, you can pretty much find the time to travel throughout the entire city if you have a guided route.
            </p>
            <p> Amsterdam, how can someone not fall in love with such a vibrant beautiful city? The canals, the cobblestone streets, the small alleys, the tiny shops and the massive parking lots for bikes (so I like to call it). Amsterdam is so picture-perfect, although if you visit you’ll find out that sometimes the camera won’t do justice.</p>
            <h1 class="text-title">Luggage Storage</h1>
            <img class="img-center" src="img/schipol-airport.png" alt="Schipol Airport luggage">
            <figcaption class="img-caption">Schipol Airport Luggage sign</figcaption>
            <p>Well for starters, I had a carryon and a backpack. Before I left the airport (Schiphol Airport) I stopped at the locker station to drop off our carryon (6 euros per bag per day). After I dropped off my luggage, I walked out of the airport to take a picture with the “I am Amsterdam” sign and then I hopped on the train to Amsterdam City Centraal Station, roughly a <span class="underline-text">30-minute</span> ride. When I arrived at the city center it was around <span class="underline-text">7:30 am.</span> Landing early was the greatest thing ever; I was able to beat the crowd and stroll around the city by foot freely for about two hours.</p>

            <h1 class="text-title">Where to walk to?</h1>

            <figcaption class="img-caption">Amsterdam Centraal</figcaption>
            <p>From City Centraal station we pretty much walked everywhere. When I was outside the station, I walked <span class="bold-text">North-west</span> towards the <span class="bold-text">Red-Light District</span> area and from there I walked through the little alleys taking tons of pictures. I stopped at Dam Square for a little while to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere and to take it all in. I then walked to the 9 streets, a trendier and upscale area in the center of Amsterdam. A bit crowded (in the afternoons) but still nice with lots of nice shops, cafes, boutiques, hotels, and bars.</p>
            <h1 class="text-title">Time to depart</h1>
            <p>Amsterdam was the perfect stop for us, it set the tone for a great first day in Europe and a great vacation afterward.<blockquote cite="https://www.solosophie.com/quotes-about-amsterdam/">Here is a quote I found interesting regarding amsterdam: </blockquote><q class="italic-text"> Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth, it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin.</q> We truly enjoyed every minute and we are glad that we were able to do a lot of things with a limited amount of time. But with Amsterdam it is possible, it is a great size city and you can do a lot in a day or in a few hours. However, we prefer to stay for a night or so in places we are visiting for the first time to really get a feel for the culture and the city. But, if we can visit Amsterdam for two hours, we’ll do it in a second. That’s how much we loved it. </p>
